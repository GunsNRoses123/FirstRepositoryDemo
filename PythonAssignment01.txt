Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
machine learning
data analysis
data engineering
front end/back end web developmeent
app development
hacking (pretty cool)

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Variables are place holders for holding any value in memory.
we can declare these variables by giving a name for example,
if i want to store a value of 5, then i can assign a variable number = 5 (assignment is usually done using a '=' operator)
which is also called as assignment operator 

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
we can take input from Python using In Built Python functiona i.e. input()

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Default data type is always a String.

Q8. What is type casting?
Type casting is if I want to convert an Integer value to float or an Integer value to String.
For example, let say I have a variable num = 6
if i want to check the type of this variable, i can use Type() fucntion which will be Integer.
Now if i want to convert the value of varaible num to String, then i can Type cast this variable.
i.e. num = str(num)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
We can take multiple inputs in Python using either Split() function or List comprehension.

Q10. What are keywords?
These are in built words for example, like True or False, If/Else/Elif/Break/Continue/return/and/or/not etc..

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
No, Variables are used for storing values.Keywords have special meaning and are reserved to do specific tasks.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
It tells what is a block of code.
for example:
if num == 5:
   print ("Hie") ---> this is indentation meaning starting from If statement to brackets..it is one piece of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Output to python can be thrown via Print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Operators are used for doing maths functions. example +,-,*,/,% these are all operators.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
'/' gives the Float division. For example: 19/2 = 9.5
'//' gives the floor division means it kinds of round off the value. For example: 91/2 = 9

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Boolean operatores are True or False.

```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
conditions are used for testing any particular test screnario.
for example: if i bring more then 45 marks in exam, then i will pass the exam or else fail the exam.
Condition : passing marks should be >= 45.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
if -> if 'condition' -> then do this
else -> if 'condition' satisfies, then execute
        else:
             execute something else.

elif -> 
if mood == 1:
   print("very good")
elif mood == 2:
   print("not that good")
elif mood == 3:
   print("stop it")
else:
   print("boring life")
